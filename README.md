INTRODUCTION
============
This is an extremely simple Web app that aggregates the various known [BMLT Root Servers](https://bmlt.magshare.net/installing-a-new-root-server/), and creates a "live" table that displays some basic statistics about those servers.
BMLTTally is a utility app that quickly polls a list of Root Servers, and displays their information in the form of a table, and a map. This started life as a "quick n' dirty one-off," so it does not cleave to the standards of the rest of the BMLT project.
